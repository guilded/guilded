Usage:

Generate:

  script/generate guilded_config
  script/generate guilded_assets


Edit the settings file at config/initializers/load_guilded_settings.rb.  Change any of these settings to reflect how
you would like Guilded to be configured.  If you change where any file(s) are configured to be located, then also move 
the respective file(s).

Next you must make a call to the view helper to apply the CSS  It should be placed in your layout:

  <%= g_apply_style %>

There is also a view helper to apply the JavaScript.  You can place this at the bottom of your layouts (so you
do not have to include it in every template):

  <%= g_apply_behavior %>

You also must reset the Guilded singleton that manages everything after each rendering.  The best way to do this is a before 
filter in your application controller:

  before_filter :reset_guilded
	
  #...
	
  protected
	
  def reset_guilded
    Guilded::Guilder.instance.reset!
  end
